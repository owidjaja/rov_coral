Steps
1. Align the coral by using the black base of the coral because it is consistent
2. Use predetermined HSV values to get pink and white masks of the coral
3. Process changes by iterating over pixels in the new coral and determine whether it is closer to
	a pink or white pixel of the old coral.
	this method of comparison is quite robust as it does not require perfect alignment of the two corals


old_src = cv2.imread("res/ref_cor.jpg")
new_src = cv2.imread("res/image.JPG")
	old_cropped: approx_height_ratio = 4
	canvas: close_ksize = 5
	new_drawn: min_area = 650
